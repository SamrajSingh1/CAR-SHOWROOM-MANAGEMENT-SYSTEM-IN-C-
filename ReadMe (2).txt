                   CAR SHOWROOM MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
========================================================================


                We have created this application for the manager and owner of a Car showroom . This application not only
               
                demonstrates the basics of using the  classes but is also a starting point for writing your 
                application.This file contains a summary of what you will find in each of the files that make up your 
                management application.

                 based on header.h and imlementation.cpp source files.

Five  classes have been created for making this application:

   Every class defines  the behavior of your application's main dialog.  The dialog's
   template is in implentation.cpp, which can be edited in Dev C++.
